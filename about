  <li>⚡ Fun fact: I have been using the username "chessmate" for about ten years at this point, and I actually got the name from the vulture in <em>Horton Hears a Who</em>. </li>

<center><h1>Technical</h1></center>
<ol>
  <li>As I said, I know how to use Django. </li>
  <li>I usually use VS code as an IDE. </li>
  <li>Since Django is a web dev framework, I also know how to use python, html, css, and regular javascript. </li>
</ol>
